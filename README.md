Project Overview: Supply Chain Dataset Analysis Dashboard in Power BI Objective: Create an interactive supply chain analysis dashboard in Power BI to provide insights into key performance metrics such as sales, profit, and order trends across different categories, regions, and customer segments.

Data Overview:

Orders: Contains details of customer orders, including order date, ship date, shipping mode, product category, sales amount, quantity, discounts, and profit. People: Employee data (if relevant to sales performance or customer management). Returns: Information on returned orders, useful for analyzing return rates and their impact on profitability. Key Insights and Visuals: Sales and Pro

Profit Overview: Total Sales, Profit, and Discounts: Summarize overall performance and present a breakdown by year or quarter. Profit Margin: Highlight profitable and less-profitable categories or regions. Product Category Performance:

Sales by Category and Sub-Category: Use bar charts or pie charts to show which product categories (e.g., Furniture, Office Supplies) generate the most revenue. Top Products: Identify the best-selling products and their contribution to total sales. Regional Performance:

Sales by Region: Display regional performance using a map or geographical heat map to highlight sales concentration. Profit by Region: Identify high-profit and low-profit regions. Customer Insights:

Customer Segmentation: Analyze the behavior of different customer segments (e.g., Corporate, Consumer) and their impact on sales. Top Customers: Highlight top customers by sales or profit. Shipping and Delivery Analysis:

Shipping Modes: Compare the efficiency and profitability of different shipping modes (Standard Class, Second Class, etc.). Order Delivery Performance: Analyze delivery timelines to ensure customer satisfaction. Return Analysis:

Returned Products: Track products that are frequently returned and analyze return rates by region or customer segment. This Power BI project would give stakeholders a detailed, visual summary of the company's sales operations, allowing them to make data-driven decisions on inventory management, marketing strategies, and customer relations.

Conclusion:  The total sales for the analyzed period amount to 2.26 million USD, involving 9800 unique customers across 529 cities.
The West and East regions lead in total sales, indicating strong markets in these areas.
Thereâ€™s an opportunity to capitalize on high-demand products like the Canon Copier and look into optimizing sales strategies for lower-performing products.
These insights provide a comprehensive view of supply chain performance, customer preferences, and potential areas for business growth.
